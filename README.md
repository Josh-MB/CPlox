# CPlox

Simple hobby project for learning about language design and implementation, following the online book by Robert Nystrom: [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). Using C++17 in creation of the interpreter instead of C as in the book.

Currently in development.

Requires CMake 3.12 and C++17.
